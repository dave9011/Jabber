# Jabber

A chat application I built to begin getting myself familiarized with Node.js and web sockets. It uses MongoDB, Socket.IO and my share
of vanilla JS to do so.

## Since this was an intro project early on in my dev experience it is fairly primitive. Therefor I wanted to try my hand out in converting
it into a roust full-stack application. I decided to keep that in a separate repo so feel free to check it out at: <https://github.com/dave9011/jabber-2.5>
